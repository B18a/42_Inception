*.conf-Files inside /etc/ngninx/conf.d This is the default directory, which nginx creates after installation. It is used to store virtual host configurations in the *.conf format. However, this is not the best approach.

*.conf-Files inside /etc/nginx/sites-available A more elegant approach is to have the .conf file of your virtual host situated in sites-available.

*.conf-Files inside /etc/nginx/sites-enabled This is where you would symlink the virtual hosts from sites-available, to make nginx read and work with them.




Check $uri: NGINX checks if there is a file /about. If it exists, it serves that file.
Check $uri/: If /about does not exist as a file, NGINX checks for a directory /about/. If found, it serves that directory.
Return 404: If neither /about nor /about/ exists, it responds with a 404 Not Found error.
